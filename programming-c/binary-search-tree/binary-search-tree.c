/*
    BINARY SEARCH TREE IMPLEMENTATION USING C::
    Okay, so here I am going to make a BST -> Binary Search True leveraging all of this
    
    1. Define a Node Structure – Create a struct for the BST node that contains:
        - An integer (or another data type) as the key/value.
        - Pointers to the left and right child nodes.

    3. Implement Core BST Functions – Write functions to:
        - Insert a new value while maintaining BST properties.
        - Search for a value in the tree.
        - Delete a node while handling different cases (leaf, one child, two children).
        - Traverse the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

    3. Handle Memory Management – Since C does not have garbage collection, use malloc for node allocation and free to prevent memory leaks.

    4. Test the Implementation – Create a main function to:
        - Insert sample values.
        - Print the tree using traversal methods.
        - Search for values.
        - Delete nodes and observe behavior.

# Similarity to Java

    Since I do underastand Java, I'm gonna associate Java and C together.

## Similarities of Java and C

    1. Syntax Similarities
        ```
            // Java
            if (x > 10) {
            System.out.println("Big number");
            }

            // C
            if (x > 10) {
            printf("Big number\n");
            }
        ```

    2. Primitive Data Types
        int, float, double, and char exist in both languages.

        Size differences: In C, the size of types depends on the system architecture, while in Java they are standardized.

    3. Functions (Methods in Java)
        ```
            // Java
            int add(int a, int b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            // C
            int add(int a, int b) {
                return a + b;
            }
        ```
    4. Pointers to Memory References
        Although Java doesnâ€™t have explicit pointers, it uses references under the hood, which is somewhat similar to C pointers.

        Learning C will help you understand memory management at a deeper level, which is abstracted away in Java.
